<h1>Contribute </h1>

<p>
	The Contribute section of the Voyages website contains data entry forms by which users
	of the website can supply revise existing information in the Voyages Database or supply
	new data. A team of slave trade scholars will review each contribution, as part of the
	peer-review process. Once confirmed, the new or revised information will be incorporated
	in the next version of the Voyages Database. We anticipate releasing a new version every
	three years.
</p>

<p>
	The Contribution entry forms take advantage of possibilities offered by the internet
	to continuously improve the store of knowledge, whether in the traditional form of written
	documents or in the new form of collections of machine-readable data. The Voyages Database
	is itself the product of extensive revisions since the publication of the CD-ROM version of
	the dataset in 1999. The Contribute section will allow the database to evolve in a way that
	respects the high standards of scholarship governing the construction of the original database.
</p>

<p>
	Step-by-step instructions on how to use the data entry forms are provided in the Voyages
	Guide, a PDF file accessible in <a href="{% url voyage:guide %}">“Understanding the Database”</a>.
	For advice on contributing new data, we ask you to read our <a href="{% url contribute:guidelines %}">“Guidelines for Contributors.”</a>
</p>

<p>
	For purposes of managing contributions to the website, contributors are asked to register
	for an account and provide an email address for communication. Once your registration is
	confirmed, you will receive an email with your user name and password, which you can use
	to access the Contribute section (below).
