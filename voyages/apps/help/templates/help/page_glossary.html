            Loading African captives into a slave ship. In West Africa slaves were embarked 
            via canoe, as slaving vessels had to anchor off shore due to a lack of natural 
            harbors. Slaves would often be kept below decks for weeks after embarkation, 
            firstly whilst they waited for the slaving master to procure a full cargo, and 
            then during the Middle Passage across the Atlantic.

            The documented
            outcome of a slaving voyage. Slavers hoped to 'complete' their voyage by 
            returning to their homeport having purchased and sold slaves. Because of the 
            risks of the sea, capture and rebellion, one in four slaving vessels failed to 
            return to their homeport.

            The number
            of female slaves. Slave traders did not prefer purchasing female slaves because 
            buyers in the Americas sought stronger 'prime males'. Slavers kept female 
            enslaved Africans separated from the males on board, and usually did not chain 
            them above or below deck. Crewmen occasionally raped females on the Coast and 
            Middle Passage.

            The national registration papers carried on board ship. During the slave trade
            suppression period, post-1810, slavers often sailed under a flag different from 
            their own nationality. In Estimates, this box enables the user to limit the 
            analysis to one or more of seven national carriers by checking boxes next to 
            those for which results will be reported. The seven national carriers are the 
            same as those found using Flag* in Search the Database, except that the latter 
            includes a category for 12 voyages under other flags. The variable Flag, without 
            an asterisk, in Search the Database contains all 16 national carriers before 
            being regrouped into a smaller number of categories. [Note: Other has 60 cases 
            here]

        <td class="glossary-description">
            Through most years of the slave trade mercantilist laws restricted slave trades
            to monopoly companies and national carriers. When companies lost monopolies in 
            the 1700s, others could trade on the African coast and in the Americas. In 1789 
            the Spanish Crown allowed ships of all nations to land slaves in American 
            colonies, such as Cuba. From 1789 to 1867 slaving ships from throughout the 
            Atlantic world docked at Havana, the most multi-national slaving port in the 
            Americas.
